# GitHub Pages Theme

Test GitHub Pages site.

The theme of this site is set to Taclite from the GitHub supported theme list.
It is possible to use a custom theme by creating `_config.yml` (this file is
also created upon selecting a theme from the supported theme list) and placing
the following code in:


```yml
theme=tomashubelbauer/github-pages-theme
```

The repository at `tomashubelbauer/github-pages-theme` must be a valid Jekyll
theme repository. Theoretically it can even be the same repository as the site
repository, such as shown above.

## To-Do
